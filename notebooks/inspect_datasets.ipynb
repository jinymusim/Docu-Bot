       "      <td>[Building dCache\\n===============\\n\\nRequirements\\n------------\\n\\nTo build dCache, you need Maven 3.5.0 or newer. Centos/Redhat 7\\ncomes with version 3.0.5. See https://maven.apache.org/install.html\\non how to install a newer version.\\n\\ndCache requires Java-11 for building. Running the resulting \\nbinaries on newer JDKs should be possible.\\n\\nBuilding\\n--------\\n\\ndCache uses Maven as a build system and as a repository of Maven\\nartifacts. A top level aggregator project allows all Maven modules to\\nbe built in one operation:\\n\\n    mvn package\\n\\nGenerated artifacts are to be found in the target directories inside\\neach component.\\n\\nSpecific modules can be build using the -am and -pl options of Maven,\\ne.g.:\\n\\n    mvn package -am -pl packages/tar\\n\\nwill build the _packages/tar_ module and all modules required by\\n_packages/tar_.\\n\\nIt is not possible to cd into a subdirectory and execute Maven on a\\nsingle module only. Such an attempt would fail because internal\\ndependencies cannot be found in any Maven repository. Instead Maven\\nmust be invoked on the top-level aggregator project with the\\nappropriate options to compile specific modules.\\n\\nAll generated files can be removed through the clean phase:\\n\\n    mvn clean\\n\\nThis phase can also be combined with other phases, e.g.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package\\n\\nPackaging dCache\\n----------------\\n\\nRPM and DEB packages can be build by compiling the _packages/fhs_\\nmodule with the _rpm_ and _deb_ profiles, respectively, i.e.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P rpm\\n\\nor\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P deb\\n\\nThe two profiles must not be invoked in the same run. \\n\\nNote that the platform native RPM and DEB build tools must be installed. \\nFor building RPMs on both CentOS and Debian platforms, installing \\nthe rpm and rpmbuild packages suffices. \\nFor building DEBs on Debian or Ubuntu platforms, the dpkg-dev, \\ndebhelper, bash-completion, sh-make, quilt, and fakeroot packages\\nmust be installed.\\n\\nThe package revision number can be customized by defining the\\nbuild.number property, e.g.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P deb -Dbuild.number=2\\n\\nRPM packages of the srmclient can be created by running the package\\nphase with the _rpm_ profile on _modules/srm-client_ module, i.e.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl modules/srm-client -P rpm\\n\\nDEB packages have not been defined for srmclient.\\n\\nThe generated packages can be found in the target directory of the\\nrespectively module. RPMs are in the RPMS subdirectory.\\n\\n\\nThe dCache tarball package is build by packaging the _packages/tar_\\nmodule:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl modules/tar\\n\\n\\nBuilding a docker image\\n-----------------------\\n\\nBuilding a container image is disabled by default.  This is because it\\nrequires a running docker deployment, which not all developers have\\ninstalled.\\n\\nYou may enable building of docker images by activating the `container`\\nprofile for the `tar` packaging:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/tar -P container\\n\\n\\nThe system-test module\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe _packages/system-test_ module generates a ready-to-run single domain dCache\\ninstance suitable for testing. It is configured to use an embedded database and\\nthus to run without postgresql. To build it simply run:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/system-test\\n\\nYou will need the `patch` utility for it to succeed.\\nThis entails a completely self-contained dCache instance in\\n`packages/system-test/target/dcache`. It can be started using:\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster start\\n\\nTo use GSI and TLS protocols, you may have to copy the test CA certificates\\ninto your `/etc/grid-security/certificates/` directory. Follow the instructions\\nshown at the end of the build.\\n\\nA test script is provided in `packages/system-test/target/bin/test` to execute\\nvarious test transfers. This script is not intended for automatic testing. It\\nrequires that various grid-related tools are available on the host.\\n\\n\\nAn interactive database console for the embedded database can be started using\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/hsqldb DATABASE\\n\\nwhere DATABASE is the database to inspect, usually a service name, eg. space\\nmanager or pin manager. The embedded database is single process, and thus the\\nconsole can only be started if dCache is not running.\\n\\n\\nMultiple versions of dCache can be tested for compatibility by installing\\nolder versions using\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster install VERSION\\n\\nThis will download a tarball release of that version and install it in\\n`packages/system-test/target`. The `ctlcluster` utility can be used to control\\nall versions at once. Using the switch subcommand, particular services can\\nbe moved between versions, eg.\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster switch pool.name=pool_write 2.7.5\\n\\nwill move the pool_write pool to version 2.7.5. The utility can however not\\ncompensate for changes in configuration properties or database schemas between\\nversions. Such incompatibilities have to be resolved manually.\\n\\n\\nUnit tests\\n----------\\n\\nBy default Maven executes all unit tests while building. This can be\\ntime consuming and will fail if no internet connection is\\navailable. The unit tests can be disabled by appending the `-DskipTests`\\noption to any mvn command.\\n]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[ACLs in dCache\\n==============\\n\\ndCache includes support for Access Control Lists (ACLs). This support is conforming to the [NFS version 4 Protocol specification](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7530.txt).\\n\\nThis chapter provides some background information and details on configuring dCache to use ACLs and how to administer the resulting system.\\n\\n-----\\n[TOC bullet hierarchy]\\n-----\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\ndCache allows control over namespace operations (e.g., creating new files and directories, deleting items, renaming items) and data operations (reading data, writing data) using the standard Unix permission model. In this model, files and directories have both owner and group-owner attributes and a set of permissions that apply to the owner, permissions for users that are members of the group-owner group and permissions for other users.\\n\\nAlthough Unix permission model is flexible enough for many deployment scenarios there are configurations that either cannot configured easily or are impossible. To satisfy these more complex permission handling dCache has support for ACL-based permission handling.\\n\\nAn Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules for determining whether an end-user is allowed to undertake some specific operation. Each ACL is tied to a specific namespace entry: a file or directory. When an end-user wishes to undertake some operation then the ACL for that namespace entry is checked to see if that user is authorised. If the operation is to create a new file or directory then the ACL of the parent directory is checked.\\n\\n&gt; **ACLs FOR FILES AND DIRECTORIES**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Each ACL is associated with a specific file or directory in dCache. Although the general form is the same whether the ACL is associated with a file or directory, some aspects of an ACL may change. Because of this, we introduce the terms file-ACL and directory-ACL when taking about ACLs associated with a file or a directory respectively. If the term ACL is used then it refers to both file-ACLs and directory-ACLs.\\n\\nEach ACL contains a list of one or more Access Control Entries (ACEs). The ACEs describe how dCache determines whether an end-user is authorised. Each ACE contains information about which group of end users it applies to and describes whether this group is authorised for some subset of possible operations.\\n\\nThe order of the ACEs within an ACL is significant. When checking whether an end-user is authorised each ACE is checked in turn to see if it applies to the end-user and the requested operation. If it does then that ACE determines whether that end-user is authorised. If not then the next ACE is checked. Thus an ACL can have several ACEs and the first matched ACE ï¿½winsï¿½.\\n\\nOne of the problems with traditional Unix-based permission model is its inflexible handling of newly created files and directories. With transitional filesystems, the permissions that are set are under the control of the user-process creating the file. The sysadmin has no direct control over the permissions that newly files or directories will have. The ACL permission model solves this problem by allowing explicit configuration using inheritance.\\n\\nACL inheritance is when a new file or directory is created with an ACL containing a set of ACEs from the parent directory's ACL. The inherited ACEs are specially marked so that only those that are intended will be inherited.\\n\\nInheritance only happens when a new file or directory is created. After creation, the ACL of the new file or directory is completely decoupled from the parent directory's ACL: the ACL of the parent directory may be altered without affecting the ACL of the new file or directory and visa versa.\\n\\nInheritance is optional. Within a directory's ACL some ACEs may be inherited whilst others are not. New files or directories will receive only those ACEs that are configured; the remaining ACEs will not be copied.\\n\\n## Configuring ACL support\\n\\nThe `dcache.conf` and layout files contain a number of settings that\\nmay be adjusted to configure dCache's permission settings. These\\nsettings are are described in this section.\\n\\nTo enable ACL support set `pnfsmanager.enable.acl`=`true` in the layout file.\\n\\n\\n```ini\\n[&lt;domainName&gt;/pnfsmanager]\\npnfsmanager.enable.acl=true\\n```\\n\\nAs NFSv4.0 protocol specification has a native ACL support, dCache's NFS door doesn't use this option and relays on `acl` option in export configurations. See [Exporting filesystem](config-nfs.md#exporting-filesystem) for details.\\n\\n### Setting and getting ACLs\\n\\nAltering dCache ACL behaviour is achieved by connecting to the `PnfsManager` [well-known cell](rf-glossary.md#well-known-cell) using the administrator interface. For further details about how to use the administrator interface, see [the section called ï¿½The Admin Interfaceï¿½](intouch.md#the-admin-interface).\\n\\nThe `setfacl` command is used to set a new ACL. This command accepts\\narguments with the following form `setfacl &lt;ID&gt; &lt;ACE&gt; [&lt;ACE&gt;...]`\\n\\nThe *ID* argument is either a pnfs-ID or the absolute path of some file or directory in dCache. The `setfacl` command requires ordered list of one or more *ACE* separated by spaces. Any existing ACEs for that *ID* will be replaced. The format and description of these ACE values are described below.\\n\\nThe `getfacl` is used to obtain the current ACL for objects in dCache namespace. It takes the following arguments.\\n\\n    getfacl [pnfsId] | [globalPath]\\n\\nThe `getfacl` command fetches the ACL information of a namespace item (a file or directory). The item may be specified by its PNFS-ID or its absolute path.\\n\\n#### Description of the ACE structure\\n\\nThe *ACE* arguments to the `setfacl` command have a specific format. This format is described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).\\n\\n    [1]\\tACE\\t::=\\tSubject ':' Access |\\n                            Subject ':' Access ':' Inheritance\\n    [2]\\tSubject\\t::=\\t'USER:' UserID | 'GROUP:' GroupID |\\n        'OWNER@' |\\n        'GROUP@' |\\n        'EVERYONE@' |\\n        'ANONYMOUS@' |\\n        'AUTHENTICATED@'\\n    [3]\\tAccess\\t::=\\t'+' Mask |\\n        '-' Mask\\n    [4]\\tMask\\t::=\\tMask MaskItem |\\n        MaskItem\\n    [5]\\tMaskItem\\t::=\\t'r' | 'l' | 'w' | 'f' | 's' | 'a' | 'n' | 'N' | 'x' | 'd' | 'D' | 't' | 'T' | 'c' | 'C' | 'o'\\n    [6]\\tInheritance\\t::=\\tInheritance Flag | Flag\\n    [7]\\tFlag\\t::=\\t'f' | 'd' | 'o'\\n    [8]\\tUserID\\t::=\\tINTEGER\\n    [9]\\tGroupID\\t::=\\tINTEGER\\nThe various options are described below.\\n\\n##### The Subject\\n\\nThe [Subject](#the-subject) defines to which user or group of users the ACE will apply. It acts as a filter so that only those users that match the Subject will have their access rights affected.\\n\\nAs indicated by the EBNF above, the Subject of an ACE can take one of several forms. These are described below:\\n\\n**USER:id**\\nThe `USER:` prefix indicates that the ACE applies only to the specific end-user: the dCache user with ID *id*. For example, `USER:0:+w` is an ACE that allows user 0 to write over a file's existing data.\\n\\n**GROUP:id**\\nThe `GROUP:` prefix indicates that the ACE applies only to those end-users who are a member of the specific group: the dCache group with ID *id*. For example, `GROUP:20:+a` is an ACE that allows any user who is a member of group 20 to append data to the end of a file.\\n\\n**OWNER@**\\nThe `OWNER@` subject indicates that the ACE applies only to whichever end-user owns the file or directory. For example, `OWNER@:+d` is an ACE that allows the file's or directory's owner to delete it.\\n\\n**GROUP@**\\nThe `GROUP@` subject indicates that the ACE applies only to all users that are members of the group-owner of the file or directory. For example, `GROUP@:+l` is an ACE that allows any user that is in a directory's group-owner to list the directory's contents.\\n\\n**EVERYONE@**\\nThe `EVERYONE@` subject indicates that the ACE applies to all users. For example, `EVERYONE@:+r` is an ACE that makes a file world-readable.\\n\\n&gt; It is important to note that \"EVERYONE@\" is not equivalent to the UNIX \"other\" entity.  This is because, by definition, UNIX \"other\" does not include the owner or owning group of a file. \"EVERYONE@\" means literally everyone, including the owner or owning group.\\n\\n**ANONYMOUS@**\\nThe `ANONYMOUS@` Subject indicates that the ACE applies to all users who have not authenticated themselves. For example, `ANONYMOUS@:-l` is an ACE that prevents unauthenticated users from listing the contents of a directory.\\n\\n`AUTHENTICATED@`\\nThe `AUTHENTICATED@` Subject indicates that an ACE applies to all authenticated users. For example, `AUTHENTICATED@:+r` is an ACE that allows any authenticated user to read a file's contents.\\n\\n&gt; **AUTHENTICATED OR ANONYMOUS**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; An end user of dCache is either authenticated or is unauthenticated, but never both. Because of this, an end user operation will either match ACEs with `ANONYMOUS@` Subjects or `AUTHENTICATED@` Subjects but the request will never match both at the same time.\\n\\n##### Access mask\\n\\n[Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) (defined in the [ACE EBNF](#description-of-the-ace-structure) above) describes what kind of operations are being described by the ACE and whether the ACE is granting permission or denying it.\\n\\nAn individual ACE can either grant permissions or deny them, but never both. However, an ACL may be composed of any mixture of authorising- and denying- ACEs. The first character of [Access](##description-of-the-ace-structure) describes whether the ACE is authorising or denying.\\n\\nIf [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) begins with a plus symbol (`+`) then the ACE authorises the [Subject](#description-of-the-ace-structure) some operations. The ACE `EVERYONE@:+r` authorises all users to read a file since the ACE-ACCESS begins with a `+`.\\n\\nIf the [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) begins with a minus symbol (`-`) then the ACE denies the [Subject](#description-of-the-ace-structure) some operations. The ACE `EVERYONE@:-r` prevents any user from reading a file since the Access begins with a `-`.\\n\\nThe first character of [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) must be `+` or `-`, no other possibility is allowed. The initial `+` or `-` of [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) is followed by one or more operation letters. These letters form the ACE's *access mask* ([Mask](#description-of-the-ace-structure) in [ACE EBNF](#description-of-the-ace-structure) above).\\n\\nThe access mask describes which operations may be allowed or denied by the ACE. Each type of operation has a corresponding letter; for example, obtaining a directory listing has a corresponding letter `l`. If a user attempts an operation of a type corresponding to a letter present in the access mask then the ACE may affect whether the operation is authorised. If the corresponding letter is absent from the access mask then the ACE will be ignored for this operation.\\n\\nThe following table describes the access mask letters and the corresponding operations:\\n\\n&gt; **FILE- AND DIRECTORY- SPECIFIC OPERATIONS**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Some operations and, correspondingly, some access mask letters only make sense for ACLs attached to certain types of items. Some operations only apply to directories, some operations are only for files and some operations apply to both files and directories.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; When configuring an ACL, if an ACE has an operation letter in the access mask that is not applicable to whatever the ACL is associated with then the letter is converted to an equivalent. For example, if `l` (list directory) is in the access mask of an ACE that is part of a file-ACL then it is converted to `r`. These mappings are described in the following table.\\n\\n**r**\\nreading data from a file. Specifying `r` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to read a file's contents. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `l`.\\n\\n**l**\\nlisting the contents of a directory. Specifying `l` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to list a directory's contents. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then the letter is converted to `r`.\\n\\n**w**\\noverwriting a file's existing contents. Specifying `w` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to write data anywhere within the file's current offset range. This includes the ability to write to any arbitrary offset and, as a result, to grow the file. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `f`.\\n\\n**f**\\ncreating a new file within a directory. Specifying `f` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to create a new file. If the ACE is part of an file-ACL then then the letter is converted to `w`.\\n\\n**s**\\ncreating a subdirectory within a directory. Specifying `s` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to create new subdirectories. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then the letter is converted to `a`.\\n\\n**a**\\nappending data to the end of a file. Specifying `a` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to add data to the end of a file. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `s`.\\n\\n**n**\\nreading attributes. Specifying `n` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to read attributes. This letter may be specified in ACEs that are part of a file-ACL and those that are part of a directory-ACL.\\n\\n**N**\\nwrite attributes. Specifying `N` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to write attributes. This letter may be specified in ACEs that are part of a file-ACL and those that are part of a directory-ACL.\\n\\n**x**\\nexecuting a file or entering a directory. `x` may be specified in an ACE that is part of a file-ACL or a directory-ACL; however, the operation that is authorised will be different.\\n\\nSpecifying **x** in an ACEs access mask that is part of a file-ACL will control whether end users matching the ACE Subject are allowed to execute that file.\\n\\nSpecifying **x** in an ACEs access mask that is part of a directory-ACL will control whether end users matching ACE Subject are allowed to search a directory for a named file or subdirectory. This operation is needed for end users to change their current working directory.\\n\\n**d**\\ndeleting a namespace entry. Specifying **d** in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to delete the file or directory the ACL is attached. The end user must be also authorised for the parent directory (see `D`).\\n\\n**D**\\ndeleting a child of a directory. Specifying **D** in the access mask of an ACE that is part of a directory-ACL controls whether end-users are allowed to delete items within that directory. The end user must be also authorised for the existing item (see **d**).\\n\\n**t**\\nreading basic attributes. Specifying `t` in the access mask of an ACE controls whether end users are allowed to read basic (i.e., non-ACL) attributes of that item.\\n\\n**T**\\naltering basic attributes. Specifying `T` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to alter timestamps of the item the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**c**\\nreading ACL information. Specifying `c` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to read the ACL information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**C**\\nwriting ACL information. Specifying `C` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to update ACL information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**o**\\naltering owner and owner-group information. Specifying `o` controls whether end users are allowed to change ownership information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n##### ACL inheritance\\n\\nTo enable ACL inheritance, the optional [inheritance flags](#description-of-the-ace-structure) must be defined. The flag is a list of letters. There are three possible letters that may be included and the order doesn't matter.\\n\\n**f**\\nThis inheritance flag only affects those ACEs that form part of an directory-ACL. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then specifying `f` has no effect.\\n\\nIf a file is created in a directory with an ACE with `f` in inheritance flags then the ACE is copied to the newly created file's ACL. This ACE copy will not have the `f` inheritance flag.\\n\\nSpecifying `f` in an ACE's inheritance flags does not affect whether this ACE is inherited by a newly created subdirectory. See `d` for more details.\\n\\n**d**\\nThis inheritance flag only affect those ACEs that form part of an directory-ACL. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then specifying `d` has no effect.\\n\\nSpecifying `d` in an ACE's inheritance flags does not affect whether this ACE is inherited by a newly created file. See `f` for more details.\\n\\nIf a subdirectory is created in a directory with an ACE with `d` in the ACE's inheritance flag then the ACE is copied to the newly created subdirectory's ACL. This ACE copy will have the `d` inheritance flag specified. If the `f` inheritance flag is specified then this, too, will be copied.\\n\\n**o or r**\\nThe `o` flag may only be used when the ACE also has the `f`, `d` or both `f` and `d` inheritance flags. The `o` flag is the same as the `r` flag.\\n\\nSpecifying `o` in the inheritance flag will suppress the ACE. No user operations will be authorised or denied as a result of such an ACE.\\n\\nWhen a file or directory inherits from an ACE with `o` in the inheritance flags then the `o` is *not* present in the newly created file or directory's ACE. Since the newly created file or directory will not have the `o` in it's inheritance flags the ACE will take effect.\\n\\nAn `o` in the inheritance flag allows child files or directories to inherit authorisation behaviour that is different from the parent directory.\\n\\n**g**\\nThe `g` inheritance flag indicates this ACE refers to a group.\\n\\n### Accessing ACL over NFS mount\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, NFSv4.0 natively supports ACL. On linux system there are two commands to get and set ACLs - `nfs4_getfacl` and `nfs4_setfacl`. The both commands are are a part of `nfs4-acl-tools` package and available on most of the modern linux distributions.\\n\\n    $ nfs4_setfacl -ï¿½s 'A::user@domain:r' file.X\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::user@domain:r\\n    A::OWNER@:rwaDxtTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:rwaDxtc\\n    A::EVERYONE@:rxtc\\n\\nFor other operations systems, usually ACL manipulation integrated into `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands.\\n\\n#### Combining UNIX permissions with ACLs\\n\\nWhen file's permission is changed with `chmod` command, then files ACL is adjusted to reflect new permissions.\\n\\n    $ nfs4_setfacl ï¿½a 'A::EVERYONE@:rw' file.X\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::EVERYONE@:rwtc\\n    A::OWNER@:rwatTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:rwatc\\n    $ chmod 000 file.X    # &lt;==ï¿½ ACL are adjusted here\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::OWNER@:tTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:t\\n    A::EVERYONE@:t\\n    $\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nThis section gives some specific examples of how to set ACLs to achieve some specific behaviour.\\n\\n### Example 1\\n\\nACL allowing specific user to delete files in a directory\\n\\nThis example demonstrates how to configure a directory-ACL so user\\n3750 can delete any file within the directory\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`.\\n\\n    (PnfsManager) admin &gt; setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir EVERYONE@:+l USER:3750:D\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:of\\n    (PnfsManager) admin &gt; setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir/existingFile1\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:f\\n    (PnfsManager) admin &gt; setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir/existingFile2\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:f\\n\\nThe first command creates an ACL for the directory. This ACL has three ACEs. The first ACE allows anyone to list the contents of the directory. The second ACE allows user 3750 to delete content within the directory in general. The third ACE is inherited by all newly created files and specifies that user 3750 is authorised to delete the file independent of that file's ownership.\\n\\nThe second and third commands creates an ACL for files that already exists within the directory. Since ACL inheritance only applies to newly created files or directories, any existing files must have an ACL explicitly set.\\n\\n### Example 2\\n\\nACL to deny a group  #\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates authorising all end users to list a directory. Members of group 1000 can also create subdirectories. However, any member of group 2000 can do neither.\\n\\n    (PnfsManager) admin &gt; setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir GROUP:2000:-sl\\n        (...line continues...)    EVERYONE@:+l GROUP:1000:+s\\n\\nThe first ACE denies any member of group 2000 the ability to create subdirectories or list the directory contents. As this ACE is first, it takes precedence over other ACEs.\\n\\nThe second ACE allows everyone to list the directory's content. If an end user who is a member of group 2000 attempts to list a directory then their request will match the first ACE so will be denied. End users attempting to list a directory that are not a member of group 2000 will not match the first ACE but will match the second ACE and will be authorised.\\n\\nThe final ACE authorises members of group 1000 to create subdirectories. If an end user who is a member of group 1000 and group 2000 attempts to create a subdirectory then their request will match the first ACE and be denied.\\n\\n### Example 3\\n\\nACL to allow a user to delete all files and subdirectories\\n\\nThis example is an extension to [Example 18.1, ï¿½ACL allowing specific user to delete files in a directoryï¿½](#example-18.1.-acl-allowing-specific-user-to-delete-files-in-a-directory). The previous example allowed deletion of the contents of a directory] but not the contents of any subdirectories. This example allows user 3750 to delete all files and subdirectories within the directory.\\n\\n\\n   (PnfsManager) admin &gt; setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir USER:3750:+D:d\\n        (...line continues...)    USER:3750:+d:odf\\n\\nThe first ACE is `USER:3750:+D:d`. This authorises user 3750 to delete\\nany contents of directory `/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir` that has\\nan ACL authorising them with `d` operation.\\n\\nThe first ACE also contains the inheritance flag `d` so newly created subdirectories will inherit this ACE. Since the inherited ACE will also contain the `d` inheritance flag, this ACE will be copied to all subdirectories when they are created.\\n\\nThe second ACE is `USER:3750:+d:odf`. The ACE authorises user 3750 to\\ndelete whichever item the ACL containing this ACE is associated\\nwith. However, since the ACE contains the `o` in the inheritance\\nflags, user 3750 is *not* authorised to delete the directory\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`\\n\\nSince the second ACE has both the `d` and `f` inheritance flags, it\\nwill be inherited by all files and subdirectories of\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`, but without the `o` flag. This\\nauthorises user 3750 to delete these items.\\n\\nSubdirectories (and files) will inherit the second ACE with both `d`\\nand `f` inheritance flags. This implies that all files and\\nsub-subdirecties within a subdirectory of\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir` will also inherit this ACE, so\\nwill also be deletable by user 3750.\\n\\n### Example 4\\n\\nObtain ACL information by absolute path\\n\\n       (PnfsManager) admin &gt; getfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir\\n        ACL: rsId = 00004EEFE7E59A3441198E7EB744B0D8BA54, rsType = DIR\\n        order = 0, type = A, accessMsk = lfsD, who = USER, whoID = 12457\\n        order = 1, type = A, flags = f, accessMsk = lfd, who = USER, whoID = 87552\\n        In extra format:\\n        USER:12457:+lfsD\\n        USER:87552:+lfd:f\\n\\nThe information is provided twice. The first part gives detailed information about the ACL. The second part, after the `In extra format:` heading, provides a list of ACEs that may be used when updating the ACL using the `setfacl` command.\\n\\n]</td>\n",

dCache\\n===============\\n\\nRequirements\\n------------\\n\\nTo build dCache, you need Maven 3.5.0 or newer. Centos/Redhat 7\\ncomes with version 3.0.5. See https://maven.apache.org/install.html\\non how to install a newer version.\\n\\ndCache requires Java-11 for building. Running the resulting \\nbinaries on newer JDKs should be possible.\\n\\nBuilding\\n--------\\n\\ndCache uses Maven as a build system and as a repository of Maven\\nartifacts. A top level aggregator project allows all Maven modules to\\nbe built in one operation:\\n\\n    mvn package\\n\\nGenerated artifacts are to be found in the target directories inside\\neach component.\\n\\nSpecific modules can be build using the -am and -pl options of Maven,\\ne.g.:\\n\\n    mvn package -am -pl packages/tar\\n\\nwill build the _packages/tar_ module and all modules required by\\n_packages/tar_.\\n\\nIt is not possible to cd into a subdirectory and execute Maven on a\\nsingle module only. Such an attempt would fail because internal\\ndependencies cannot be found in any Maven repository. Instead Maven\\nmust be invoked on the top-level aggregator project with the\\nappropriate options to compile specific modules.\\n\\nAll generated files can be removed through the clean phase:\\n\\n    mvn clean\\n\\nThis phase can also be combined with other phases, e.g.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package\\n\\nPackaging dCache\\n----------------\\n\\nRPM and DEB packages can be build by compiling the _packages/fhs_\\nmodule with the _rpm_ and _deb_ profiles, respectively, i.e.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P rpm\\n\\nor\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P deb\\n\\nThe two profiles must not be invoked in the same run. \\n\\nNote that the platform native RPM and DEB build tools must be installed. \\nFor building RPMs on both CentOS and Debian platforms, installing \\nthe rpm and rpmbuild packages suffices. \\nFor building DEBs on Debian or Ubuntu platforms, the dpkg-dev, \\ndebhelper, bash-completion, sh-make, quilt, and fakeroot packages\\nmust be installed.\\n\\nThe package revision number can be customized by defining the\\nbuild.number property, e.g.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/fhs -P deb -Dbuild.number=2\\n\\nRPM packages of the srmclient can be created by running the package\\nphase with the _rpm_ profile on _modules/srm-client_ module, i.e.:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl modules/srm-client -P rpm\\n\\nDEB packages have not been defined for srmclient.\\n\\nThe generated packages can be found in the target directory of the\\nrespectively module. RPMs are in the RPMS subdirectory.\\n\\n\\nThe dCache tarball package is build by packaging the _packages/tar_\\nmodule:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl modules/tar\\n\\n\\nBuilding a docker image\\n-----------------------\\n\\nBuilding a container image is disabled by default.  This is because it\\nrequires a running docker deployment, which not all developers have\\ninstalled.\\n\\nYou may enable building of docker images by activating the `container`\\nprofile for the `tar` packaging:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/tar -P container\\n\\n\\nThe system-test module\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe _packages/system-test_ module generates a ready-to-run single domain dCache\\ninstance suitable for testing. It is configured to use an embedded database and\\nthus to run without postgresql. To build it simply run:\\n\\n    mvn clean package -am -pl packages/system-test\\n\\nYou will need the `patch` utility for it to succeed.\\nThis entails a completely self-contained dCache instance in\\n`packages/system-test/target/dcache`. It can be started using:\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster start\\n\\nTo use GSI and TLS protocols, you may have to copy the test CA certificates\\ninto your `/etc/grid-security/certificates/` directory. Follow the instructions\\nshown at the end of the build.\\n\\nA test script is provided in `packages/system-test/target/bin/test` to execute\\nvarious test transfers. This script is not intended for automatic testing. It\\nrequires that various grid-related tools are available on the host.\\n\\n\\nAn interactive database console for the embedded database can be started using\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/hsqldb DATABASE\\n\\nwhere DATABASE is the database to inspect, usually a service name, eg. space\\nmanager or pin manager. The embedded database is single process, and thus the\\nconsole can only be started if dCache is not running.\\n\\n\\nMultiple versions of dCache can be tested for compatibility by installing\\nolder versions using\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster install VERSION\\n\\nThis will download a tarball release of that version and install it in\\n`packages/system-test/target`. The `ctlcluster` utility can be used to control\\nall versions at once. Using the switch subcommand, particular services can\\nbe moved between versions, eg.\\n\\n    packages/system-test/target/bin/ctlcluster switch pool.name=pool_write 2.7.5\\n\\nwill move the pool_write pool to version 2.7.5. The utility can however not\\ncompensate for changes in configuration properties or database schemas between\\nversions. Such incompatibilities have to be resolved manually.\\n\\n\\nUnit tests\\n----------\\n\\nBy default Maven executes all unit tests while building. This can be\\ntime consuming and will fail if no internet connection is\\navailable. The unit tests can be disabled by appending the `-DskipTests`\\noption to any mvn command.\\n]   \n",

Beside HEP\\nspecific protocols, data in dCache can be accessed via __NFSv4.1\\n(pNFS)__, __FTP__ as well as through __WebDav__.\\n\\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/9113580.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/9113580)\\n\\nDocumentation\\n=============\\n\\n[The dCache book](docs/TheBook/src/main/markdown/index.md)\\n\\n[User Guide](docs/UserGuide/src/main/markdown/index.md)\\n\\nGetting Started\\n===============\\n\\nThe file [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) describes how to compile dCache\\ncode and build various packages.\\n\\nThe file also describes how to create the __system-test__ deployment,\\nwhich provides a quick and easy way to get a working dCache.  Running\\nsystem-test requires no special privileges and all the generated files\\nreside within the code-base.\\n\\nThere are also packages of stable releases at https://www.dcache.org/downloads/.\\n\\nLicense\\n=======\\n\\nThe project is licensed under __AGPL v3__. Some parts licensed under __BSD__ and __LGPL__. See the source code for details.\\n\\nFor more info, check the official [dCache.ORG](http://www.dcache.org) web page.\\n\\nContributors\\n============\\ndCache is a joint effort between\\n[Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY](http://www.desy.de),\\n[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](http://www.fnal.gov)\\nand [Nordic DataGrid Facility](http://www.ndgf.org).\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n=================\\n\\n**dCache** uses the linux kernel model where git is not only source repository,\\nbut also the way to track contributions and copyrights.\\n\\nEach submitted patch must have a \"Signed-off-by\" line.  Patches without\\nthis line will not be accepted.\\n\\nThe sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the\\npatch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to\\npass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you\\ncan certify the below:\\n```\\n\\n    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1\\n\\n    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\\n\\n    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\\n         have the right to submit it under the open source license\\n         indicated in the file; or\\n\\n    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\\n        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\\n        license and I have the right under that license to submit that\\n        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\\n        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\\n        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\\n        in the file; or\\n\\n    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\\n        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\\n        it.\\n\\n    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\\n        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\\n        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\\n        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\\n        this project or the open source license(s) involved.\\n\\n```\\nthen you just add a line saying ( git commit -s )\\n\\n    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>\\n\\nusing your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)\\n\\nWe use an adapted version of the [`Google style guide for Java`](https://github.com/google/styleguide) that can be found in the root of this project for IntelliJ.\\nThe used reformatting involves optimization of imports (reordering), application of all syntactical sugar settings, but does not include code rearrangement (fields, methods, classes) or code cleanup for existing code. Reformatting should be applied to the changed code before submitting a patch.\\n]   \n",

       "4  [ACLs in dCache\\n==============\\n\\ndCache includes support for Access Control Lists (ACLs). This support is conforming to the [NFS version 4 Protocol specification](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7530.txt).\\n\\nThis chapter provides some background information and details on configuring dCache to use ACLs and how to administer the resulting system.\\n\\n-----\\n[TOC bullet hierarchy]\\n-----\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\ndCache allows control over namespace operations (e.g., creating new files and directories, deleting items, renaming items) and data operations (reading data, writing data) using the standard Unix permission model. In this model, files and directories have both owner and group-owner attributes and a set of permissions that apply to the owner, permissions for users that are members of the group-owner group and permissions for other users.\\n\\nAlthough Unix permission model is flexible enough for many deployment scenarios there are configurations that either cannot configured easily or are impossible. To satisfy these more complex permission handling dCache has support for ACL-based permission handling.\\n\\nAn Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules for determining whether an end-user is allowed to undertake some specific operation. Each ACL is tied to a specific namespace entry: a file or directory. When an end-user wishes to undertake some operation then the ACL for that namespace entry is checked to see if that user is authorised. If the operation is to create a new file or directory then the ACL of the parent directory is checked.\\n\\n> **ACLs FOR FILES AND DIRECTORIES**\\n>\\n> Each ACL is associated with a specific file or directory in dCache. Although the general form is the same whether the ACL is associated with a file or directory, some aspects of an ACL may change. Because of this, we introduce the terms file-ACL and directory-ACL when taking about ACLs associated with a file or a directory respectively. If the term ACL is used then it refers to both file-ACLs and directory-ACLs.\\n\\nEach ACL contains a list of one or more Access Control Entries (ACEs). The ACEs describe how dCache determines whether an end-user is authorised. Each ACE contains information about which group of end users it applies to and describes whether this group is authorised for some subset of possible operations.\\n\\nThe order of the ACEs within an ACL is significant. When checking whether an end-user is authorised each ACE is checked in turn to see if it applies to the end-user and the requested operation. If it does then that ACE determines whether that end-user is authorised. If not then the next ACE is checked. Thus an ACL can have several ACEs and the first matched ACE ï¿½winsï¿½.\\n\\nOne of the problems with traditional Unix-based permission model is its inflexible handling of newly created files and directories. With transitional filesystems, the permissions that are set are under the control of the user-process creating the file. The sysadmin has no direct control over the permissions that newly files or directories will have. The ACL permission model solves this problem by allowing explicit configuration using inheritance.\\n\\nACL inheritance is when a new file or directory is created with an ACL containing a set of ACEs from the parent directory's ACL. The inherited ACEs are specially marked so that only those that are intended will be inherited.\\n\\nInheritance only happens when a new file or directory is created. After creation, the ACL of the new file or directory is completely decoupled from the parent directory's ACL: the ACL of the parent directory may be altered without affecting the ACL of the new file or directory and visa versa.\\n\\nInheritance is optional. Within a directory's ACL some ACEs may be inherited whilst others are not. New files or directories will receive only those ACEs that are configured; the remaining ACEs will not be copied.\\n\\n## Configuring ACL support\\n\\nThe `dcache.conf` and layout files contain a number of settings that\\nmay be adjusted to configure dCache's permission settings. These\\nsettings are are described in this section.\\n\\nTo enable ACL support set `pnfsmanager.enable.acl`=`true` in the layout file.\\n\\n\\n```ini\\n[<domainName>/pnfsmanager]\\npnfsmanager.enable.acl=true\\n```\\n\\nAs NFSv4.0 protocol specification has a native ACL support, dCache's NFS door doesn't use this option and relays on `acl` option in export configurations. See [Exporting filesystem](config-nfs.md#exporting-filesystem) for details.\\n\\n### Setting and getting ACLs\\n\\nAltering dCache ACL behaviour is achieved by connecting to the `PnfsManager` [well-known cell](rf-glossary.md#well-known-cell) using the administrator interface. For further details about how to use the administrator interface, see [the section called ï¿½The Admin Interfaceï¿½](intouch.md#the-admin-interface).\\n\\nThe `setfacl` command is used to set a new ACL. This command accepts\\narguments with the following form `setfacl <ID> <ACE> [<ACE>...]`\\n\\nThe *ID* argument is either a pnfs-ID or the absolute path of some file or directory in dCache. The `setfacl` command requires ordered list of one or more *ACE* separated by spaces. Any existing ACEs for that *ID* will be replaced. The format and description of these ACE values are described below.\\n\\nThe `getfacl` is used to obtain the current ACL for objects in dCache namespace. It takes the following arguments.\\n\\n    getfacl [pnfsId] | [globalPath]\\n\\nThe `getfacl` command fetches the ACL information of a namespace item (a file or directory). The item may be specified by its PNFS-ID or its absolute path.\\n\\n#### Description of the ACE structure\\n\\nThe *ACE* arguments to the `setfacl` command have a specific format. This format is described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).\\n\\n    [1]\\tACE\\t::=\\tSubject ':' Access |\\n                            Subject ':' Access ':' Inheritance\\n    [2]\\tSubject\\t::=\\t'USER:' UserID | 'GROUP:' GroupID |\\n        'OWNER@' |\\n        'GROUP@' |\\n        'EVERYONE@' |\\n        'ANONYMOUS@' |\\n        'AUTHENTICATED@'\\n    [3]\\tAccess\\t::=\\t'+' Mask |\\n        '-' Mask\\n    [4]\\tMask\\t::=\\tMask MaskItem |\\n        MaskItem\\n    [5]\\tMaskItem\\t::=\\t'r' | 'l' | 'w' | 'f' | 's' | 'a' | 'n' | 'N' | 'x' | 'd' | 'D' | 't' | 'T' | 'c' | 'C' | 'o'\\n    [6]\\tInheritance\\t::=\\tInheritance Flag | Flag\\n    [7]\\tFlag\\t::=\\t'f' | 'd' | 'o'\\n    [8]\\tUserID\\t::=\\tINTEGER\\n    [9]\\tGroupID\\t::=\\tINTEGER\\nThe various options are described below.\\n\\n##### The Subject\\n\\nThe [Subject](#the-subject) defines to which user or group of users the ACE will apply. It acts as a filter so that only those users that match the Subject will have their access rights affected.\\n\\nAs indicated by the EBNF above, the Subject of an ACE can take one of several forms. These are described below:\\n\\n**USER:id**\\nThe `USER:` prefix indicates that the ACE applies only to the specific end-user: the dCache user with ID *id*. For example, `USER:0:+w` is an ACE that allows user 0 to write over a file's existing data.\\n\\n**GROUP:id**\\nThe `GROUP:` prefix indicates that the ACE applies only to those end-users who are a member of the specific group: the dCache group with ID *id*. For example, `GROUP:20:+a` is an ACE that allows any user who is a member of group 20 to append data to the end of a file.\\n\\n**OWNER@**\\nThe `OWNER@` subject indicates that the ACE applies only to whichever end-user owns the file or directory. For example, `OWNER@:+d` is an ACE that allows the file's or directory's owner to delete it.\\n\\n**GROUP@**\\nThe `GROUP@` subject indicates that the ACE applies only to all users that are members of the group-owner of the file or directory. For example, `GROUP@:+l` is an ACE that allows any user that is in a directory's group-owner to list the directory's contents.\\n\\n**EVERYONE@**\\nThe `EVERYONE@` subject indicates that the ACE applies to all users. For example, `EVERYONE@:+r` is an ACE that makes a file world-readable.\\n\\n> It is important to note that \"EVERYONE@\" is not equivalent to the UNIX \"other\" entity.  This is because, by definition, UNIX \"other\" does not include the owner or owning group of a file. \"EVERYONE@\" means literally everyone, including the owner or owning group.\\n\\n**ANONYMOUS@**\\nThe `ANONYMOUS@` Subject indicates that the ACE applies to all users who have not authenticated themselves. For example, `ANONYMOUS@:-l` is an ACE that prevents unauthenticated users from listing the contents of a directory.\\n\\n`AUTHENTICATED@`\\nThe `AUTHENTICATED@` Subject indicates that an ACE applies to all authenticated users. For example, `AUTHENTICATED@:+r` is an ACE that allows any authenticated user to read a file's contents.\\n\\n> **AUTHENTICATED OR ANONYMOUS**\\n>\\n> An end user of dCache is either authenticated or is unauthenticated, but never both. Because of this, an end user operation will either match ACEs with `ANONYMOUS@` Subjects or `AUTHENTICATED@` Subjects but the request will never match both at the same time.\\n\\n##### Access mask\\n\\n[Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) (defined in the [ACE EBNF](#description-of-the-ace-structure) above) describes what kind of operations are being described by the ACE and whether the ACE is granting permission or denying it.\\n\\nAn individual ACE can either grant permissions or deny them, but never both. However, an ACL may be composed of any mixture of authorising- and denying- ACEs. The first character of [Access](##description-of-the-ace-structure) describes whether the ACE is authorising or denying.\\n\\nIf [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) begins with a plus symbol (`+`) then the ACE authorises the [Subject](#description-of-the-ace-structure) some operations. The ACE `EVERYONE@:+r` authorises all users to read a file since the ACE-ACCESS begins with a `+`.\\n\\nIf the [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) begins with a minus symbol (`-`) then the ACE denies the [Subject](#description-of-the-ace-structure) some operations. The ACE `EVERYONE@:-r` prevents any user from reading a file since the Access begins with a `-`.\\n\\nThe first character of [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) must be `+` or `-`, no other possibility is allowed. The initial `+` or `-` of [Access](#description-of-the-ace-structure) is followed by one or more operation letters. These letters form the ACE's *access mask* ([Mask](#description-of-the-ace-structure) in [ACE EBNF](#description-of-the-ace-structure) above).\\n\\nThe access mask describes which operations may be allowed or denied by the ACE. Each type of operation has a corresponding letter; for example, obtaining a directory listing has a corresponding letter `l`. If a user attempts an operation of a type corresponding to a letter present in the access mask then the ACE may affect whether the operation is authorised. If the corresponding letter is absent from the access mask then the ACE will be ignored for this operation.\\n\\nThe following table describes the access mask letters and the corresponding operations:\\n\\n> **FILE- AND DIRECTORY- SPECIFIC OPERATIONS**\\n>\\n> Some operations and, correspondingly, some access mask letters only make sense for ACLs attached to certain types of items. Some operations only apply to directories, some operations are only for files and some operations apply to both files and directories.\\n>\\n> When configuring an ACL, if an ACE has an operation letter in the access mask that is not applicable to whatever the ACL is associated with then the letter is converted to an equivalent. For example, if `l` (list directory) is in the access mask of an ACE that is part of a file-ACL then it is converted to `r`. These mappings are described in the following table.\\n\\n**r**\\nreading data from a file. Specifying `r` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to read a file's contents. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `l`.\\n\\n**l**\\nlisting the contents of a directory. Specifying `l` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to list a directory's contents. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then the letter is converted to `r`.\\n\\n**w**\\noverwriting a file's existing contents. Specifying `w` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to write data anywhere within the file's current offset range. This includes the ability to write to any arbitrary offset and, as a result, to grow the file. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `f`.\\n\\n**f**\\ncreating a new file within a directory. Specifying `f` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to create a new file. If the ACE is part of an file-ACL then then the letter is converted to `w`.\\n\\n**s**\\ncreating a subdirectory within a directory. Specifying `s` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to create new subdirectories. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then the letter is converted to `a`.\\n\\n**a**\\nappending data to the end of a file. Specifying `a` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to add data to the end of a file. If the ACE is part of a directory-ACL then the letter is converted to `s`.\\n\\n**n**\\nreading attributes. Specifying `n` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to read attributes. This letter may be specified in ACEs that are part of a file-ACL and those that are part of a directory-ACL.\\n\\n**N**\\nwrite attributes. Specifying `N` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to write attributes. This letter may be specified in ACEs that are part of a file-ACL and those that are part of a directory-ACL.\\n\\n**x**\\nexecuting a file or entering a directory. `x` may be specified in an ACE that is part of a file-ACL or a directory-ACL; however, the operation that is authorised will be different.\\n\\nSpecifying **x** in an ACEs access mask that is part of a file-ACL will control whether end users matching the ACE Subject are allowed to execute that file.\\n\\nSpecifying **x** in an ACEs access mask that is part of a directory-ACL will control whether end users matching ACE Subject are allowed to search a directory for a named file or subdirectory. This operation is needed for end users to change their current working directory.\\n\\n**d**\\ndeleting a namespace entry. Specifying **d** in an ACE's access mask controls whether end-users are allowed to delete the file or directory the ACL is attached. The end user must be also authorised for the parent directory (see `D`).\\n\\n**D**\\ndeleting a child of a directory. Specifying **D** in the access mask of an ACE that is part of a directory-ACL controls whether end-users are allowed to delete items within that directory. The end user must be also authorised for the existing item (see **d**).\\n\\n**t**\\nreading basic attributes. Specifying `t` in the access mask of an ACE controls whether end users are allowed to read basic (i.e., non-ACL) attributes of that item.\\n\\n**T**\\naltering basic attributes. Specifying `T` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to alter timestamps of the item the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**c**\\nreading ACL information. Specifying `c` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to read the ACL information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**C**\\nwriting ACL information. Specifying `C` in an ACE's access mask controls whether end users are allowed to update ACL information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n**o**\\naltering owner and owner-group information. Specifying `o` controls whether end users are allowed to change ownership information of the item to which the ACE's ACL is attached.\\n\\n##### ACL inheritance\\n\\nTo enable ACL inheritance, the optional [inheritance flags](#description-of-the-ace-structure) must be defined. The flag is a list of letters. There are three possible letters that may be included and the order doesn't matter.\\n\\n**f**\\nThis inheritance flag only affects those ACEs that form part of an directory-ACL. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then specifying `f` has no effect.\\n\\nIf a file is created in a directory with an ACE with `f` in inheritance flags then the ACE is copied to the newly created file's ACL. This ACE copy will not have the `f` inheritance flag.\\n\\nSpecifying `f` in an ACE's inheritance flags does not affect whether this ACE is inherited by a newly created subdirectory. See `d` for more details.\\n\\n**d**\\nThis inheritance flag only affect those ACEs that form part of an directory-ACL. If the ACE is part of a file-ACL then specifying `d` has no effect.\\n\\nSpecifying `d` in an ACE's inheritance flags does not affect whether this ACE is inherited by a newly created file. See `f` for more details.\\n\\nIf a subdirectory is created in a directory with an ACE with `d` in the ACE's inheritance flag then the ACE is copied to the newly created subdirectory's ACL. This ACE copy will have the `d` inheritance flag specified. If the `f` inheritance flag is specified then this, too, will be copied.\\n\\n**o or r**\\nThe `o` flag may only be used when the ACE also has the `f`, `d` or both `f` and `d` inheritance flags. The `o` flag is the same as the `r` flag.\\n\\nSpecifying `o` in the inheritance flag will suppress the ACE. No user operations will be authorised or denied as a result of such an ACE.\\n\\nWhen a file or directory inherits from an ACE with `o` in the inheritance flags then the `o` is *not* present in the newly created file or directory's ACE. Since the newly created file or directory will not have the `o` in it's inheritance flags the ACE will take effect.\\n\\nAn `o` in the inheritance flag allows child files or directories to inherit authorisation behaviour that is different from the parent directory.\\n\\n**g**\\nThe `g` inheritance flag indicates this ACE refers to a group.\\n\\n### Accessing ACL over NFS mount\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, NFSv4.0 natively supports ACL. On linux system there are two commands to get and set ACLs - `nfs4_getfacl` and `nfs4_setfacl`. The both commands are are a part of `nfs4-acl-tools` package and available on most of the modern linux distributions.\\n\\n    $ nfs4_setfacl -ï¿½s 'A::user@domain:r' file.X\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::user@domain:r\\n    A::OWNER@:rwaDxtTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:rwaDxtc\\n    A::EVERYONE@:rxtc\\n\\nFor other operations systems, usually ACL manipulation integrated into `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands.\\n\\n#### Combining UNIX permissions with ACLs\\n\\nWhen file's permission is changed with `chmod` command, then files ACL is adjusted to reflect new permissions.\\n\\n    $ nfs4_setfacl ï¿½a 'A::EVERYONE@:rw' file.X\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::EVERYONE@:rwtc\\n    A::OWNER@:rwatTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:rwatc\\n    $ chmod 000 file.X    # <==ï¿½ ACL are adjusted here\\n    $ nfs4_getfacl file.X\\n    A::OWNER@:tTcC\\n    A::GROUP@:t\\n    A::EVERYONE@:t\\n    $\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nThis section gives some specific examples of how to set ACLs to achieve some specific behaviour.\\n\\n### Example 1\\n\\nACL allowing specific user to delete files in a directory\\n\\nThis example demonstrates how to configure a directory-ACL so user\\n3750 can delete any file within the directory\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`.\\n\\n    (PnfsManager) admin > setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir EVERYONE@:+l USER:3750:D\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:of\\n    (PnfsManager) admin > setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir/existingFile1\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:f\\n    (PnfsManager) admin > setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir/existingFile2\\n        (...line continues...)   USER:3750:+d:f\\n\\nThe first command creates an ACL for the directory. This ACL has three ACEs. The first ACE allows anyone to list the contents of the directory. The second ACE allows user 3750 to delete content within the directory in general. The third ACE is inherited by all newly created files and specifies that user 3750 is authorised to delete the file independent of that file's ownership.\\n\\nThe second and third commands creates an ACL for files that already exists within the directory. Since ACL inheritance only applies to newly created files or directories, any existing files must have an ACL explicitly set.\\n\\n### Example 2\\n\\nACL to deny a group  #\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates authorising all end users to list a directory. Members of group 1000 can also create subdirectories. However, any member of group 2000 can do neither.\\n\\n    (PnfsManager) admin > setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir GROUP:2000:-sl\\n        (...line continues...)    EVERYONE@:+l GROUP:1000:+s\\n\\nThe first ACE denies any member of group 2000 the ability to create subdirectories or list the directory contents. As this ACE is first, it takes precedence over other ACEs.\\n\\nThe second ACE allows everyone to list the directory's content. If an end user who is a member of group 2000 attempts to list a directory then their request will match the first ACE so will be denied. End users attempting to list a directory that are not a member of group 2000 will not match the first ACE but will match the second ACE and will be authorised.\\n\\nThe final ACE authorises members of group 1000 to create subdirectories. If an end user who is a member of group 1000 and group 2000 attempts to create a subdirectory then their request will match the first ACE and be denied.\\n\\n### Example 3\\n\\nACL to allow a user to delete all files and subdirectories\\n\\nThis example is an extension to [Example 18.1, ï¿½ACL allowing specific user to delete files in a directoryï¿½](#example-18.1.-acl-allowing-specific-user-to-delete-files-in-a-directory). The previous example allowed deletion of the contents of a directory] but not the contents of any subdirectories. This example allows user 3750 to delete all files and subdirectories within the directory.\\n\\n\\n   (PnfsManager) admin > setfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir USER:3750:+D:d\\n        (...line continues...)    USER:3750:+d:odf\\n\\nThe first ACE is `USER:3750:+D:d`. This authorises user 3750 to delete\\nany contents of directory `/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir` that has\\nan ACL authorising them with `d` operation.\\n\\nThe first ACE also contains the inheritance flag `d` so newly created subdirectories will inherit this ACE. Since the inherited ACE will also contain the `d` inheritance flag, this ACE will be copied to all subdirectories when they are created.\\n\\nThe second ACE is `USER:3750:+d:odf`. The ACE authorises user 3750 to\\ndelete whichever item the ACL containing this ACE is associated\\nwith. However, since the ACE contains the `o` in the inheritance\\nflags, user 3750 is *not* authorised to delete the directory\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`\\n\\nSince the second ACE has both the `d` and `f` inheritance flags, it\\nwill be inherited by all files and subdirectories of\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir`, but without the `o` flag. This\\nauthorises user 3750 to delete these items.\\n\\nSubdirectories (and files) will inherit the second ACE with both `d`\\nand `f` inheritance flags. This implies that all files and\\nsub-subdirecties within a subdirectory of\\n`/pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir` will also inherit this ACE, so\\nwill also be deletable by user 3750.\\n\\n### Example 4\\n\\nObtain ACL information by absolute path\\n\\n       (PnfsManager) admin > getfacl /pnfs/example.org/data/exampleDir\\n        ACL: rsId = 00004EEFE7E59A3441198E7EB744B0D8BA54, rsType = DIR\\n        order = 0, type = A, accessMsk = lfsD, who = USER, whoID = 12457\\n        order = 1, type = A, flags = f, accessMsk = lfd, who = USER, whoID = 87552\\n        In extra format:\\n        USER:12457:+lfsD\\n        USER:87552:+lfd:f\\n\\nThe information is provided twice. The first part gives detailed information about the ACL. The second part, after the `In extra format:` heading, provides a list of ACEs that may be used when updating the ACL using the `setfacl` command.\\n\\n]   \n",
