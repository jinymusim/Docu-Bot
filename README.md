# RAG on Git repositories
This project is a solution to utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation on Git Repositories.  

## Requirements

Python >= 3.10

### Windows

Windows requires additional Visual C++ 2015 build tools to be installed.  
They are available on Microsoft website [Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Selected models

Following model was selected as Default models for Embedding.

- Embedding Model: [text-embedding-3-small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models)

To change it, rewrite the default value in ***MODEL_TYPES.py***

The Default LLM model was seleted as:

- LLM Model: [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates)

But this is changable in the ***Config*** section, allowing user to choose OpenAI LLM of their choice.


## Number of Retrieved Files

The approximate number of files retrived durring Document Retrival is defined in ***CONTEXT_SIZE.py***.

- ***GIT_DOCUMENTS*** defines approximate number of documents that will be taken from all branches of git repo together
- ***GIT_DIVERSE_K*** defines the divese field from with most disimilar documents will be taken
- ***SHARED_DOCUMENTS*** defines approximate number of documents that will be taken from all requested zips
- ***SHARED_DIVERSE_K*** is same as ***GIT_DIVERSE_K***

These numbers can be altered. The selected values were observed to be good midleground in information correctness and size.

## How to Run
To run, clone this repository and install dependancies in following steps
```
pip install  -r requirements.txt
```
To run the solution, run python on script gradio_app_git_update.py

```
python gradio_app_git_update.py
```
This will produce a link to a frontend UI.  
To utilize OpenAI models it is required to provide API key in the ***Config*** section.

### Provide Companny API key

If maneged behined authetication system, API key can be set as a default option.  
The user inputed API key will be used if inputed.  

To set company wide key, set eviromental variable OPENAI_API_KEY that will be utilized by the application.
```Windows
# Windows
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY=Company API key
```
```Linux
# Linux
export OPENAI_API_KEY=Company API key
```
